#Palindrome Checker Algorithm

Description: This algorithm checks if a given word is a palindrome.

A word is considered a palindrome if it reads the same from left to right as well as from right to left.

Algorithm: Define two pointers, word and reverseworld.

Line 7-19 is a FOR LOOP that will reverse our words so we can compare the last character to the first character in the word

Line 22-24 is an IF statment to check if the word is a single character or an empty word , if the condition is true, it will return a palidrome

Line 27 compare the last character of the two words if they are the same, then go further to compare the rest of the characters.

Line 29 Iterate through the entire character to find if the words are same then the code return Palindrome

Line 33 will return NOT A Palindrome if the conditions are not met

End of Algorithm
